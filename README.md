## What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-). It enables communication over long distances through visual signals, sound, or radio waves. Each letter of the alphabet, numeral, and some punctuation are represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

## Historical Context
Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use with the electric telegraph. It became a standard for long-distance communication, especially in maritime and military contexts, due to its simplicity and reliability. Morse code played a crucial role during the World Wars and remains useful in emergency situations where voice communication is not possible.

## How Morse Code System Works
Morse code encodes characters using short signals called dots (.) and longer signals called dashes (-):
- **Dot (.)**: Represents a short signal lasting one time unit.
- **Dash (-)**: Represents a longer signal lasting three time units.

Spacing rules:
- The space between parts of the same letter: one time unit.
- The space between letters: three time units.
- The space between words: seven time units.

**Example:**
- The letter 'A' is encoded as `.-`
- The letter 'B' is `-...`
- The number '1' is `.----`

This system's simplicity and efficiency have allowed Morse code to be used in various forms of communication for nearly two centuries.
